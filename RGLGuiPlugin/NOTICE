This product includes software developed by
Open Source Robotics Foundation (https://www.openrobotics.org)

Originated from https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-gui/blob/gz-gui7/src/plugins/point_cloud.
About one third of the code is changed to better suit the needs of Robotec.ai.
Main changes include overhaul of marker usage and deleting FloatV msgs usage in GUI (no colour gradient supported now).
